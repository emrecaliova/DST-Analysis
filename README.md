# DST Analysis Fortran Program

## üåç Overview

This repository contains a Fortran-based program that calculates solar timing parameters such as **sunrise**, **sunset**, **sunlight duration**, and **working hours in darkness** for multiple cities over a multi-year period. The program is designed to assist in analyzing **Daylight Saving Time (DST)** effectiveness and solar-work alignment across various geographic regions.

## üì§ Output Format

 ### `output.csv`

Each row contains the analyzed DST-related daily data for a specific date and city such as:

```python-repl 
  CITY,TIMEZONE,YEAR,MONTH,DAY,TOT_WORKING_HOURS,STR_SRT,STR_SST,STR_SWH,STR_EWH,STR_WORKINDARK,STR_SLD,STR_NTD
  ANTALYA,  2.0,2024, 1, 1,  9.00,07:10:02,16:50:27,07:00:00,16:00:00,00:09:59,09:40:26,14:19:34
  ANTALYA,  2.0,2024, 1, 2,  9.00,07:10:12,16:51:13,07:00:00,16:00:00,00:09:59,09:41:01,14:18:59
  ...
  ANKARA,  2.5,2025, 7,24,  9.00,05:09:52,19:40:20,08:30:00,17:30:00,00:00:00,14:30:28,09:29:32
  ...
```

- `CITY`: Name of the city (string)
- `TIMEZONE`: UTC Timezone (real number)
- `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`: Date values
- `TOT_WORKING_HOURS`: Total working hours in a day (real number)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Compile and Run

### üìå Requirements

- Fortran compiler (e.g., `gfortran`)

### üßµ Compile

```bash
gfortran -o dst_analysis dst_analysis.f90
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

```bash
./dst_analysis
```

The program will:

**1.** Read `cities.csv`

**2.** Process each city over multiple years

**3.** Save the results to `output.csv` and `summary.csv`

## üìà Use Cases

The program can be used in its current form or with minor modifications for the following purposes:

- Analyzing DST policies across countries or time zones
- Estimating seasonal variation in solar work alignment
- Urban energy planning or lighting optimization
- Scientific research in solar geometry, climatology, or human productivity

## üß† Background and Developer Note

This program was developed by **Emre √áalƒ±ova** during undergraduate studies at **Istanbul Technical University (ITU)** as part of a research project investigating the impacts of Turkey's **permanent daylight saving time (DST)** policy. This program has been updated and provided for the GitHub repository. It may differ from the program used in the research.

In 2016, Turkey adopted permanent DST to make better use of daylight throughout the year. This policy shift raised public and academic interest, particularly regarding its implications on **energy consumption**, **human circadian rhythms**, and **daily life schedules**. Accurate computation of **sunrise and sunset times** became essential for these assessments.

This program was created to support daylight saving time assessments by providing precise sun position calculations and darkness during working hours based on geographic and temporal inputs.

The solar position calculations are based on methods from:

- U.S. NOAA Solar Calculator
- Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus
